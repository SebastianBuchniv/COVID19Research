Caveats:
"1. Population estimates and projections are updated periodically, population estimates and projections produced in the preceding"
"years are superseded by the most recent population series for the same years. Population estimates are preferred to projections"
"when estimates are available, unless the objective is to compare numbers with others in the projected series."
